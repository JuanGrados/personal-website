I am a passionate maker who loves bringing things to life. It could be a new IoT sensor, a 3D printed part, a custom PCB or something new and interesting. I enjoy the process of design, prototyping, and iteration to create innovative solutions. 


My background in Physics brought me to Hamburg, Germany, where I did my PhD in Particle Physics at DESY. After my PhD, I briefly worked as a Software Developer and then as R&D in Biophysics. Currently, I work as researcher in urban production in the context of Circular Economy and the FabCity project.


In my free time I like to tinker and create new things, whether it is a new project or a small upgrade to an existing one, and that is why I started this website to document and share my projects. I hope you find something interesting here!
